# LAMBDA-EXPRESSION-AND-STREAMS
Please create a Student class consisting of three fields: name, surname, score. 
But also the constructor, the get and set access methods and the toStringmethod.
In a separate class, please create a method that will create objects of the Student class based on the studentsEN.txt file (located on the Platon platform) and place them in a collection (can be ArrayList).
In the main method, I am asking you to create three streams operating on the 
ArrayList (with Student objects), each stream should do a different thing:
1) Find students with a grade of 5 and print them on the console,
2) Calculate the average of all students' grades,
3) Calculate how many students we have with a grade of 5.
